## What is Pooch?

Pooch is a simple, fun interface for NFT creators, investors, and enthusiasts to transfer their NFTs across blockchains.

Our team:
* ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ Michael Yankelev - NFT minting, integrations
* ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ Ryan Noble - Front-end
* ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Cindy Chau - NFT design, front-end
* ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Megan Doyle - UX/UI design, content & copy
* ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Liesl Eichholz - UX/UI design, content & copy


## How is it made?

Pooch is designed to be compatible with any blockchain that has implemented [ChainBridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge)'s ERC721 handler. The initial demo connects Ethereum's GÃ¶rli and Kotti testnets, but the interface is designed to be arbitrarily composable, connecting with any ChainBridge implementation with a few minor tweaks.
